"""collapse to a single canonical project

Revision ID: 007_canonical_project
Revises: 006_custom_asset_types
Create Date: 2026-05-29

Single-project model (docs/CHANTIER_PROJET_UNIQUE.md): one client / one IS =
ONE project, with a well-known UUID shared across every module and Pilot.
Collapses an existing per-deployment random project onto the canonical id,
non-destructively (data repointed, not dropped).

  - 0 projects  → insert the canonical project.
  - 1 project, already canonical → no-op (idempotent).
  - 1 project, other id → rename to canonical, repoint every child table.
  - >1 projects → ABORT loudly (manual merge required).
